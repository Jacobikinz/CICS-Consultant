## Division of Labor
Thomas Callaghan: Created the DB and all functionality surrounding the database. Created this documentation. 

Jacob Urisman: Wrote almost all of the final documentation, created the fields json which most parts of the project rely on for dynamic updating. Also created the fields overview page dynamically.

Pablo Castilla: Decided which classes to include, which fields are added, and which classes belong in which fields (in conjunction w/ Jacob). Scraped data from CICS website, and created classes.json. I also recorded and edited the final video.

Hannah Wu: Finalized the CSS for the quiz buttons and cleaned up the HTML.
