## Division of Labor
Thomas Callaghan: Created the DB and all functionality surrounding the database. Created this documentation. 

Everyone else: Helped with Heroku deployments and did more surrounding the final touches of this project like scraping the CICS course descriptions website and 
turning it into JSON, etc. There is better documentation of division of labor in the final.md document.
