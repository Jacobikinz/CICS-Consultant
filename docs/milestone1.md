## Data Interactions

- Account creation: the user enters credentials like first name, last name, email, and password to create a new account.<br>
- Login: the user will enter their username/email and password to login, which will be authenticated by the database.<br>
- Track catalog: view descriptions of different areas in CS, along with suggested electives and careers.<br>
- Quiz: the service will take a variety of data types from the different types of quiz questions, then process it to show the result. A user may choose to save their progress, in which case the data will be saved as an object in the database.<br>
- Scheduler: After either completing an Interest Profile or selecting a pre-defined track from the Track Catalog, the user enters how many graduation requirements they still need to fulfill and how many semesters they have left to generate a list of recommended courses to take.
