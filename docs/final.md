# Final Documentation

## Title: Nic Asnes Fan Club

## Subtitle: CICS Consultant

## Semester: Spring 2022

## Link to project: https://cics-consultant.herokuapp.com/

## Overview:

Our application seeks to better inform CICS students on what courses they might enjoy based on courses that they have enjoyed previously. It uses our proprietary classification of CICS courses into 8 relatively distinct fields.

## Team Members:

A list of your team members, with names and GitHub aliases.

## User Interface:

A final up-to-date list/table describing your applicationâ€™s user interface. This should include the name of the UI view and its purpose. You should include a screenshot of each of your UI views.
1. Homepage
  - The homepage of our application is a quiz, which asks users to input all classes they have taken. There is then a button which locks in a user's answers and sends them to the database.
  - Then, the next part of the quiz appears, which asks users to rank each class they have taken. There is another button at the bottom of this, which sends the class enjoyment information for the users to the database, as well as computing the final step.
  - The final step is taking the information from the quiz and determining which field most likely suits the user best. The information is sent to the database and then displayed on the screen.
2. Fields
  - This page contains 8 cards, one for each field. Each card contains every class which we have placed in said field. Each class is an accordion which displays course id and title when collapsed, and course description in the accordion dropdown.
3. About Us
  - The about us page contains information on the application and each of our group members.
4. Sign-up
  - The sign-up page features a simple registration page for creating a user, with fields for first and last name, email, and password. The user is created in the database upon registration.
5. Login
  - The login page works fairly straightforwardly and allows a user to login to their account to update their preferences, which are stored in the database.

## APIs:

### Create:

Users can be created by clicking on the blue "Sign-up" button in the top right of any page on the website. This brings them to the sign-up page which has the user enter their first name, last name, email, and a password. They then click the green "Sign-up" button that is in the form they just filled out which causes the client to throw out a create to the server via `/signupUser`

`POST /signupUser`  
`headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}`  
`body: JSON.stringify({ fname: fname, lname: lname, email: email, password: password })`  

This will respond with either a `status 400` if a user already exists with the inputted email, or a `status 200` if the user is successfully created. In the backend, a new row will be added to the DB for this user. This will also cause the user to go to the profile page and the headers will change to **allow access to the user's profile and a sign-out button.**

### Read:

Users can Login by clicking the "Login" button in the top right of any page on the website. This brings them to the login page which has the user enter their email and password that is then checked against the database for authentication. If they are valid, the user will then be logged in, and be redirected to the profile page. Also, the headers will change to **allow access to the user's profile and a sign-out button.**

`GET /loginUser`  
`headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'email': email, 'password': password}`  

There is no body because GET requests cannot contain a body.

This will respond with either a `status 400` if there is no account with that email, or if the password is incorrect for the account with that email. If the email and password are valid and match, the server will respond with a `status 200` and the user will be redirected to the profile page.

### Update:

#### User Updating Their Information (email)

Users can update the email associated with their account by clicking on the "Profile" button and then the "Update your information" button. This allows the user to enter in a new email for their account and then by clicking the "Confirm new info" button, their email will be updated via a PUT request sent to the server.

`PUT /newInfo`  
`headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}`  
`body: JSON.stringify({ oldemail: userEmailCookie, newemail: newemail })`  

This will respond with a `status 500` along with the error if there was a server error while trying to update the email, or a `status 200` if the email was successfully updated.

#### User Signing Out

Users can sign-out of their account at any time by clicking the "Sign Out" button in the top right corner.

`PUT /signoutUser`  

This contains no headers or body because it is just trying to signal to the server that the user wants to signout

The server always returns with a `status 200` for this API request because all it is doing is setting the `loggedIn` variable in the server code to false.

#### User Updating A User's Quiz Answers

When a user clicks any of the buttons (aka classes) on the home page (aka the quiz page) then their selected classes are saved to the database in the respective column.

`PUT /updateQuiz`  
`headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}`  
`body: JSON.stringify({email: JSON.parse(document.cookie)['useremail'], quiz: quiz.json}),`  

Here, quiz.json is an class that we are using in the backend to render the homepage with buttons that form a "quiz" that the user can take. This will eventually be used to determine which path a user should most likely take in their career both academically and profesionally. The cookie is taking the email of the currently logged in user from the document's cookie to pass it along to the server.

This will respond with a `status 500` along with the error if there was a server error, or a `status 200` if it was successful. The user's responses are updated in the database in realtime when they are selecting things in the "quiz".

#### Loading a User's Quiz Answers On Page Load

When a user loads the home page then their quiz answers need to be loaded in from the database.

`PUT /loadQuiz`  
`headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}`  
`body: JSON.stringify({email: JSON.parse(document.cookie)['useremail']}),`  

This will respond with a `status 500` along with the error if there was a server error, or a `status 200` if the data was successfully loaded from the DB. The response will also include the appropriate data from the DB.

#### User Updating A User's Recommended Field

When a user clicks on the button after ranking all of the classes that they have taken, their recommended field is computed and if the user is logged in, this is inserted into their row in the database.

`PUT /updateRecommendation`  
`headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}`  
`body: JSON.stringify({email: JSON.parse(document.cookie)['useremail'], recommendation: topField}),`  

This is sending the cookie with the user who is currently logged in's email and their "top field" which was the field that had the highest score after the user's rankings. If the user is not logged in athen there will be no cookie to send which will then have no database action taken.

This will respond with a `status 500` along with the error if there was a server error, or a `status 200` if it was successful. The user's recommendation is updated in the database after they click the button to get their reommended field.

#### Checking if there is a logged in user

Whenever a page is loaded on the website, there needs to be a check to see if there is currently a user logged in in order to serve the correct HTML files with the correct headers.

`PUT /setLoggedIn`  
`headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}`  
`body: JSON.stringify({email: JSON.parse(document.cookie)}),`  

This needs to send the document's cookie in order to determine if there is currently a user logged in to the website, and if there is then it will be serving back a boolean in JSON that will determine what header to use on that page.

This will respond with a `status 500` along with the error if there was a server error, or a `status 200` if it was successful. The header is then successfully loaded with the correct bottons.

### Delete:

Users can delete their profile by clicking on the "Profile" button and then the red "Delete Your Profile" button. This will delete the user from the database (local storage).

`DELETE /deleteUser`  
`headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}`  
`body: JSON.stringify({ email: userEmailCookie })`

userEmailCookie is the current user's email that is being stored inside of the website's cookies

This will respond with a `status 500` along with the error if there was a server error while trying to delete the user, or a `status 200` if the user was successfully deleted.

## Database:

A final up-to-date representation of your database including a brief description of each of the entities in your data model and their relationships if any. There is only one table in our database and that is the users table that is storing the data about users once they have registered along with their activity when they are logged in. ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23635947/167011915-d0f7e2ab-236e-4ea7-b636-b13164ccfd8d.png)

# TODO: ADD THE ENTITIES IN DATA MODEL AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS

### Entities

- Username/Password
  - Stored as strings in database
- Classes
  - Stored as json file. Each course contains department id, course number, course title, number of credits, semesters offered, and the description of the course.
- Fields
  - Stored as json file. Each field contains a name, an array of course numbers as strings, and a full name for the field.
  - Courses can be taken from class json using the course number.
- Class enjoyment ranking
  - Stored as an array of classes for each enjoyment level (1-5).
  - Can check fields json for which field contains which classes.

## URL Routes/Mappings:

- html/about.html
- html/home.html
- html/login.html
- html/profile.html
  - login authentication required (email and password)
- html/signup.html
- html/fields.html

## Authentication/Authorization:

A final up-to-date description of how users are authenticated and any permissions for specific users (if any) that you used in your application. You should mention how they relate to which UI views are accessible.

## Division of Labor:

A breakdown of the division of labor for each team member â€” that is, saying who did what, for the entire project. Remember that everyone is expected to contribute roughly equally to each phase of the project. We expect to see similar numbers and kinds of GitHub commits by each student.

Thomas Callaghan: For milestone 1, I drew out the wireframes, created the website's first iteration of the header, wrote the HTML for the homepage and created dropdowns which was our first iteration of the "quiz", added the FAQ page that had accordions that has since been scrapped as a whole page, and added login/signup buttons along with some basic code to make the logging/signing in work.

For milestone 2, I wrote the large majority of the documentation that was needed for the submission, created all API endpoints surrounding the authentication of user's (/signupUser, /loginUser, /newInfo, /signoutUser, and /deleteUser), implemented the Heroku Postgres DB and then implemented the code my teammates wrote for the homepage "quiz" with the DB by creating more API endpoints (/updateQuiz and /loadQuiz), tested it all, deployed it, and assisted in the planning of this milestone.

For this final milestone, (I had skipped ahead a bit on milestone 2 by already implementing the heroku postgres DB, so I don't want to double-count that) I wrote the JS to dynamically create buttons on the home page from the classes JSON, wrote the JS that would then take those selected classes and produce radio buttons when the user was finished selecting classes, wrote the JS for calculating which field the user should pursue given their selections throughout the "quiz" through comparing this to the fields JSON, linted all the JS, validated all the HTML, cleaned up all the code, and started this final documentation by writing the API section and most of the Database section.

Jacob Urisman: For milestone 1, I created a preliminary fields page with a division of courses based on Ben Marlin's spreadsheet of interest fields and which classes were in them.

For milestone 2, I assisted in the planning of the milestone. I also set up the Heroku application, including connecting it to GitHub, setting up the CLI and making it secure.

For this final milestone, I wrote the final.md doc, created the fields json which most parts of the project rely on for dynamic updating. I also created the fields overview page dynamically.
