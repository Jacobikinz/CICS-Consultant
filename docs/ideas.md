## Innovative Idea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our application is designed to solve a problem that exists within UMass CICS, and that is choosing classes that are best for you. There isn't a whole lot of choice in the matter until you get to your spring semester in your Sophomore year or later, and then you have nearly all the choices in the world which can be quite overwhelming. Unless you are well acquainted with CICS students who are older than you and have taken the upper-level electives, it’s pretty challenging to choose the best courses for you. This is where this application was born - one of the members of our group is set on an advanced CS degree with a path into academia while another is set on getting solely a bachelor's degree to then work as an industry software engineer. Both of us have different interests in the courses we want to take along with courses that we should take as they will theoretically best assist our respective career paths. CICS used to offer more tailored “tracks” or “concentrations” but that is no longer the case, and that is the core of what CICS-Consultant is out to create. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The closest “application” that exists to what we are trying to create isn’t an application at all and [is a very outdated webpage that shows the old “BS Subplans” that existed for computer science majors prior to 2016](https://www.cics.umass.edu/ugrad-education/concentrations). Thus, in a way, there is no existing application for our specific use case.


## Important Components
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **CICS Track Catalog:** View descriptions of different areas in CS, along with suggested electives and careers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Interest Profiler:** Take an assessment on what you're interested in studying and your future goals, then view your unique profile on what kind of CS student you are! Each personal profile includes match percentages with different fields in CS, and an overall 'type' diagnosis. This will be based on [research](https://www.ijitee.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v8i12/J97550881019.pdf) on how personality relates to success in CS. A user may choose to save their progress.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Schedule Advisor:** After either completing an Interest Profile or selecting a pre-defined track from the Track Catalog, the user enters how many graduation requirements they still need to fulfill and how many semesters they have left to generate a list of recommended courses to take.<br>
