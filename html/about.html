            <b>Thomas Callaghan</b> Hi! I am Thomas Callaghan, a junior studying Computer Science with a minor in Business. I have tried to focus the studies in my degree on software engineering but ultimately decided to take web programming as my IE because I felt that I would learn more in this class. I think my guess was right! Regardless, I am still pursuing software engineering in general as a career and have completed a few internships in it. I have worked on the POS integration team at Crunchtime, the enterprise tools team at Staples, the solutions team with 128 technology at Juniper Networks, and this coming summer I am going to work with the data feeds team at Addepar. Beyond my major, I am an avid boardgame and videogame player, car enthusiast, and (hopefully) soon to be world-traveler as I am going to study abroad in Cyprus at the University of Nicosia next fall!
